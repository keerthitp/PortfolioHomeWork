                  <p>  To begin with, I like to live in the moment and not worry about too much about life.  <br>
                      
                    Live Love Laugh is my motto. I believe that life without laugh is unimaginable. So just laugh when problems come. <br>

                        I love to cook when there is time and follow new recipes on the Internet. I wont try them but like follow :) Just to keep up with the world!<br>

                        During my high school, I was crazy about Chemistry. Loved the formulas and equation. Thought of becoming a Chemical Engineer. But I chose to go with Computers. I am glad that 
                        I didn't pursue Chemistry since the thought of modifying an element that is found in the nature is against my rules. 
                        <br>
                        Talking about nature, I like to walk and can watch the clouds, beach waves, mountains for hours by sitting in a chair and with a cup of cold / hot drink.
                        <br>
                        If there is a thing that I cannot live without then that would be computers and Televison. Can binge watch TV sontinously with good food in hand. I do not know when to stop it. That is the 
                        same thing with Novels too.<br>
